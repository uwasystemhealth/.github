# Adding Readme
Create a new file and call it "readme.md", and put information on it.

The common pieces of information that are ideal to have are:
- A paragraph describing your repository
    - What is it about?
    - What is it used for?
    - Author Description
- Table of Contents (if there are a lot of long sections for the repository)
- File Structure (if there are a lot of folders and a structure)
- Installation and Setup Guide (if there is a need for installation)
- Licenses (if there is a declared License)
