# About The System Health Lab

The mission of the UWA System Health Lab (SHL) is “to imagine a richer university experience for digitally savvy students” by “bringing a start-up mentality and technologically curious students to industry-motivated research projects.”

We provide a dynamic environment for engineering, computing and mathematics students to work on multi-disciplinary projects aimed at improving the maintenance of physical assets.
