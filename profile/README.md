# About The System Health Lab
The mission of the UWA System Health Lab (SHL) is “to imagine a richer university experience for digitally savvy students” by “bringing a start-up mentality and technologically curious students to industry-motivated research projects.”

We provide a dynamic environment for engineering, computing and mathematics students to work on multi-disciplinary projects aimed at improving the maintenance of physical assets.

The repository of the System Health Lab can be seen here. The section below will outline the different categories that the SHL mainly operates on.
