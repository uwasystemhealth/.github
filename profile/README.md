## Organizing Repository
So you've been assigned a repository in the System Health Lab github. There are a couple of things that you have to do in order to get organize:
- Add a **readme** to your repository. This tells us the general overview of the repository
- Put a **description** to your repository. This short description will be seen while searching for your repository
- Put a **tag/"topic"** for your repository. This helps classify your repository. See [Tags / Topics](#tags--topics) to see what tags are being used.

For information on how to put readme, description or tags to your repository, see [here](https://github.com/uwasystemhealth/AboutUs/blob/master/OrganizingRepository.md).
